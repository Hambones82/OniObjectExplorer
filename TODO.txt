TO DO:

FIX OPEN DIALOG CRASH WHEN EMPTY

Mouse click to see objects
move handle can be attached to any window
clean up scrolls

fix disable/enable keyboard/mouse when i hit "`" key to disable overlay.


re input: one way to solve this is to just use the klei elements, which handle all the event consuming, etc... 
it seems it just converts a unity input event into a klei input event

kinputcontroller
kinputhandler
kbuttonevent


so for getinputmanager... i think i need to 

disable mouse while mouse over a panel
disable keyboard while editing a control

to detect input field... maybe we add a custom script with iselect handler...  call it disablekleikeyboardonselect

maybe add the onselects to all of the panels... or at least some of them.  then we can have some visual feedback (like a highlight) 
showing how they are receiving the keyboard presses

globals.instance.modmanager?
globals.instance.globalcanvas?

//there's also some fun stuff in Game.Onspawn--> modmanager.notifydialog pauses the game... might be useful.

nested types -- but need a good test case.
