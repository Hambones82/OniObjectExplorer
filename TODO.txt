TO DO:

- add pulldown component, make appropriate changes to generator
- refresh periodically and on value changed
- make the input (and other stuff) generic
	- as part of genericizing, add all parts that need to have game-dependencies to a special folder.

-improve the type checking in inspector generator by creating a function in the specifications thing.
